# Decision Tree 

**In this project, the decision tree is implemented and visualized without using any other libraries like sklearn.**

#### Usage
Simply run Trees and Forests.ipynb from jupyter supported platform like Jupyter Notebook

#### Example Visulasition Outputs : 

- Depth = 4 
 ![Alt text](images/Graph-depth-4.jpg?raw=true "Depth = 4 ")

- Depth = 6 
![Alt text](images/Graph-depth-6.jpg?raw=true "Depth = 6 ")

- Depth = 8
![Alt text](images/Graph-depth-8.jpg?raw=true "Depth = 8")
